# Data Directory Instructions

Place your files that you want to flash to the ESP32 in this folder.

- **Do NOT leave this README or the example `config.json` in the folder if you do not want them flashed!**
- Only the files present in this directory will be flashed to your ESP32 device.
- Use `config.json` as an example for your own configuration files; remove or replace it before flashing.
- Delete this README and any example files before flashing to avoid unintended uploads.
